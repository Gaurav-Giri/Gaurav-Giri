- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Gaurav-Giri........
all the codes i have uploaded are of my own and not copied from anywhere else.
some inspirations are taken from utube ;chatgpt assistance; google websites; and modified in my own way to meet the requirements .
the assets used in my codes were open source and are available in free in google.
